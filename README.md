## About the Video Course
Machine learning is a growing and in-demand skill, but so far JavaScript developers have not been able to take advantage of it due to the steep learning curve involved in learning a new language. TensorFlow.js is a great way to begin learning machine learning in the browser with TensorFlow.js. It allows you to operate offline to train new models and retrain existing models.

This course covers most of the major topics in machine learning and explains them with the help of Tensorflow.js implementations. The course is focused on the result-oriented nature of most JavaScript developers, and focuses on Tensorflow.js to the fullest in the least amount of time.
At the end of the course, you’ll evaluate and implement the right model to design smarter applications.
